# Example Voting App

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

## Getting started

![Architecture diagram](architecture.excalidraw.png)

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes
* A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time




## docker-compose up
### This command is used to start the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file. If the containers don't exist, they will be created.

```
docker-compose up

```

## docker-compose down
### This command is used to stop and remove the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.


```
docker-compose down

```


## To delete all networks, images, and volumes with Docker Compose, you can use the following commands:

```
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans
```


* The --rmi all flag tells Docker to remove all images associated with the containers.

* The --volumes flag tells Docker to remove any volumes associated with the containers.

* The --remove-orphans flag tells Docker to remove any containers that were not defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

```
docker network prune
docker volume prune
```

* The second command (docker network prune) will remove any unused networks.

* The third command (docker volume prune) will remove any unused volumes.
